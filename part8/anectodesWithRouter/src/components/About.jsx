    <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
    <em>
      An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an
      incident. Occasionally humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their
      primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter but to reveal a truth
      more general than the brief tale itself.
    </em>
    <p>
      Software engineering is full of excellent anecdotes, and this app is a
      collection of them.
